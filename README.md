# GomokuAI
### What is gomoku
GomokuAI is a simple game, very similar to tic-tac-toe. It is played generally on a 15x15 squares board by two players. Each player has to put down it's piece and the one that gets a '5 in a row' (either vertically, horizontally or diagonally) wins!

``` python
for i in range(10):
  doThis().test
```
